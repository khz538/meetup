# `Welcome to my Meetup Clone!`

This clone aims to mimic both the look and functionality of meetup.com.

## Challenges

On the backend server, correctly associating database tables was the most challenging.

## Improvements

1. Tidy up the backend code and perhaps add some middleware to handle errors.
2. Change the names of some db columns and tables to better clarify what they are for.
3. Add more robust seeder data for functionality's sake.
